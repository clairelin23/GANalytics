# GANalytics
Exploration of Generative Networks for Image Generation


## Project Goals
1. Complete implementation of StyleGAN (Done by me)
2. Complete implementation of DCGAN, LSGAN and WGAN-GP. Training results on two different datasets: LSUN classroom and Oxford Flowers. Comparison and analysis of the results. understand training unstability and mode collapse with respect to these three models (Done by other team members)
3. Complete implementation of the Diffusion Model. Train the Diffusion model on the Pokemon dataset to test out the pipeline of the implementation and perform visual inspection on the generated Pokemon images of the Diffusion Model (Done by other team members)
